        <h3>Stories Being Made</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                "Cloudland Park is breath-taking in the winter months, nice and cool and forests in the 
                winter are just awesome and Cherokee Falls frozen is a spectacle of itself! Frozen in time, 
                a life-changing sight!" -Cloudland Canyon State Park
            </li>
            <li>
                "A perk of camping is absolutely the night sky, the stars in the night sky are simply 
                gorgeous, totally worth any problems you encounter out in nature."
            </li>
            <li>
                "Stone Mountain is a great first hike, nice and scenic with plenty of shade along the way. 
                Not to mention the view at the top is breath-taking and somewhat terrifying. The smooth curve 
                on top of the mountain made me feel scared that I might slide right off!" -Stone Mountain
            </li>
            <li>
                "Sunsets while camping are made all the more special with my family after spending an intresting 
                and fun day camping! Just make sure to spray your kids good so they won't get bit-up! Otherwise, 
                camping is very much worth it to stand in awe of nature."
            </li>
            <li>
                "Climbing a mountain can be daunting, but taking it one step at a time and making sure to have a 
                safety checklist, you get to truly admire the superb beauty of mountains, especially at the top. 
                Camping at the base of the mountain truly is an experience."
