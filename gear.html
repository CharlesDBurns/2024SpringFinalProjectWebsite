        <h2>Gear</h2>
        <img class="camping-gear-image" src="images/camping-gear.jpg" alt-text="Camping Gear">
        <p>If only camping the gear needed is basic and minamal, being the base for other outdoor trips 
            that may last for a few days, like fishing and canoeing. The gear needed for camping can vary 
            from person to person depending on what kind of outdoor experience one wants to have. Gear 
            can help make the experience easier with tools and comforts and likewise, the lack of gear 
            can give a bit of challenge to the outing, which some seek. Of course as with any product, 
            there should be some searching to find the certain product that meets one's wants or needs to 
            make sure that they get what they specifically need. This is a list of basic items that one 
            should consider before their camping trip. Below the information is a list of the items on 
            this page that allows you to keep track of what you have already gotten.

        <p>Below is the basic gear one would generally pack for a planned camping trip.</p>

                <button class="accordion-control">Tents</button>
                <div class="accordion-panel">
                    <p>Of course the first thing you'd think about when you
                    think about camping is tents and for a good reason too. Tents are an essential 
                    for camping, they provide shelter out in nature where it might be hard to find 
                    for a new or even average camper. Tents are an absolute basic for anyone who 
                    wants to go camping. It's important to consider the size of tent for your needs 
                    as well as what conditions you want to be prepared for as some tents are more 
                    resilent to the elements than others. The more resilent tents however tend to 
                    be more expensive so strongly consider your needs before deciding on a tent.</p>

            <li>
                <button class="accordion-control">Sleeping Bags</button>
                <div class="accordion-panel">
                    <p>Sleeping Bags are equally crucial to tents for anyone 
                    camping. After all, no one likes to sleep on the ground outside, it's just not 
                    comfortable. Sleeping Bags come in an array of sizes so not only do you need 
                    to search for a decent quality sleeping bag, you need to make sure you know 
                    what size you'd require. Generally when picking a sleeping bag size it should 
                    match as closely as it can to your height, but they tend to come in small (5 
                    feet), regular (6 feet), and large (6 feet 6 inches).</p>

                <div class="accordion-panel">
                    <p>Depending on how long you plan on camping or what you 
                    want your camping experience to be, decides whether you would bring food on 
                    your trip. Generally you'd want to bring canned or jarred foods that are not 
                    easily accessible by wildlife. However if you are not camping for very long 
                    other, more loosely packaged foods may be brought but should be kept in a safe 
                    place away from where wildlife may be able to get to it. Also be aware that 
                    some parks or reserves may limit or prohibit the food you may bring into the 
                    camping site.</p>

                <div class="accordion-panel">
                    <p>Depending on the experience you want you may forego 
                    toiletries but most would want to maintain these comforts. Toiletries can vary 
                    for your prefrences and uses, but the main ones that people bring are things 
                    like toilet paper, toothbrush, and toothpaste. First Aid kits are also a big 
                    item to take on a camping trip to deal with unexpected accidents.</p>

                <button class="accordion-control">Lighter</button>
                <div class="accordion-panel">
                    <p>A lighter can be very useful in starting fires for warmth 
                    and cooking for various foods. Some may want a more survivalist experience and 
                    choose to go without and attempt to start a fire without, but generally campers 
                    bring a lighter.</p>

                <div class="accordion-panel">
                    <p>Repellants are an important and sometimes essential item 
                    to bring on a camping trip as it can help make the experience much more enjoyable. 
                    There are various repellants for different kinds of wildlife but the most prominent 
                    repellant is bug repellant that keeps away pesky bugs from you while you camp. Bugs 
                    can be the most annoying creatures you encounter out while you're camping and having 
                    some repellant can make them irrelavent. There are also other repellants like bear 
                    repellant that may be of your interest if your camping destination is where bears 
                    may be encountered.</p>
