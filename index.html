            Welcome to the camping section of our website! A brief summary of the parent website: 
            SelfBurns Productions is a company that creates multiple forms of media like animation, 
            literature and games, it also offers sites like this offering information. It was founded in 
            2024 with the goal of helping others in the creation of said forms of media and more, helping 
            people create what they want and share it with the world. To this end of helping people, sites 
            like this were created to help give information on various topics. The information on these 
            sites that is offered varies, each themed and assembled for those who are not as knowledgeable 
            on certain topics. This website is dedicated to the outdoor activity of camping, giving 
            information on the type of gear needed, desired locations and of course others' experiences to 
            help get people interested in making similar stories of their own. For that has been the goal of 
            SelfBurns Productions to begin with: to help people make stories of their own.

            Camping is the act of spending time outside in nature to admire it or to take part in particularly 
            challenging activities like rock climbing, canoeing or hiking. Typically this experience is done 
            over the period of one day or more where you would sleep outside as well, usually in a tent but some 
            sleep in cabins or RVs when they camp. When choosing to camp there are a variety of things that you 
            need to think about before hand, like what kind of gear will you need to take with you? Where should 
            you go to have your camping experience? Along with these, you'll probably have more questions and 
            hopefully this website will help you at least answer some, as well as inspire you. The home page 
            contains just this introductory information as well as a gallery of camping images to get you thinking 
            about camping. The Gear page will help you in learning what you may need to think about when looking for 
            gear as well as what gear you may need along with a checklist that may help you track what you need and 
            have. The Experiences page contains small experiences shared about camping experiences, showing what 
            kind of stories can be formed when participating in this outdoor activity. Finally, the Locations page 
            contains a location that we recommend to those who are new to camping along with a map of this location. 
            Hopefully this website will be of help to our visitors!
